Python implementation of some algorithms learned from Andrew Ng's course of Machine Learning on Coursera.

Different examples of the learning algorithms use can be found on the tests, under the *models/tests* directory. In particular, integration tests provide examples of data normalization, fitting and also accuracy of the learned model.
